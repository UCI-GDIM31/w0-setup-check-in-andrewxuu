# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
My name is Andrew and Im a third year game design student. My pronouns are He/Him. One of my hobbies is cooking, I frequently host supper clubs at my apartment and privately cook for clients. I like playing rpgs and mobas like League of Legends casually. I'm taking this class to hopefully learn more abou coding in games to expand my understanding when collaborating in teams. I have developed games in previosu classess but I used Godot, so this will be my first time using Unity. I hope to one day be able to build a fighting game. 

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ x] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I hope to gain more expeience in Unity and C#. I believe this will help me better understand the workflow of programmers when working with them in future projects like the capstone. 
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
I'm quite excited to learn Unity and collaborating with new people! 

## Prior Experience
